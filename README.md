# waffle_house
Waffle House web scraping, data analysis, and visualization. 

The initial part of this project is a simple webscraper that saves data on the location and open/hours status of each Waffle House location nationwide. This is being compiled into a google doc for use in analyzing the impacts of federal aid on economic resilience. Additional components of this analysis are forthcoming.
